#### By **Kaysha Besi**
## Description
This site takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then
depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian 
culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which 
corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Input the required fields down below to
generate your Akan name.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This is a great place
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Known Bugs
This web application is not always guaranteed to give the exact dates, on some days it'll be exact mostly in years like 2019, but years earliser than that, the outputs will be inaccurate.
## Technologies Used
For this i used HTML,CSS and Javascript. I incoporated the use of a ready made stylesheet(bootstrap). I found it much easier to style my landing page this way. In addition to that, i added my own stylesheet when i needed to input my custom styles.
