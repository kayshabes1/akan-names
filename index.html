        <h1>Akan-Names</h1>
        <p>This site takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then
           depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian 
           culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which 
           corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.
